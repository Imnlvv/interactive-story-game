# interactive-story-game
This project presents a text-based interactive story in Python, where the player’s decisions shape the plot and lead to multiple endings. The game runs entirely in the console without using external libraries.

## Project Highlights
- Branching storyline with at least three different endings
- Conditional logic for decision-making
- `while` loop for repeated actions
- `for` loop for iterating through game elements
- Use of lists, sets, and dictionaries
- Final storyline and ending automatically saved to a text file

## Tools & Technologies
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
